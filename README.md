# BenchMate
Lab bench companion app for experiment tracking

Create a list of reagents for an experiment, then check them off as you add them to each well. Then save the results to a CSV file at the end to have a log of what you added to each well.

Useful to keep track of what's already gone in for anyone who has trouble remembering what reagents they've already added. Complete with color-coded wells, red for empty, yellow for in progress, green for complete. Maps to a standard 96-well plate.

To install for Android, find us on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.benchmate&hl=en_US).
